# 🌐 AJAX and Fetch API Practice Project

This project demonstrates the use of **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and the **Fetch API** to send and receive data from a server without refreshing the entire page. It is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and serves as a learning tool for asynchronous data handling in web development.

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 Send HTTP requests using `fetch()`
- 🔄 Update the DOM without page reload
- ✅ Handle server responses dynamically
- ❌ Error handling with user feedback
- 🧪 Clean and simple structure for learning

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Asynchronous:** Fetch API & XMLHttpRequest (AJAX)
- **Backend (Optional):** Can be connected to mock APIs like JSONPlaceholder or local servers
